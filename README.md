# Linear Regression without any packages.
Linear regression is a statistical method used to find relationships between two variables: a independent variable and a dependent variable.
The simplest form of the regression equation with one dependent and one independent variable is defined by the formula y = mx+c, where y = estimated dependent variable value, c = constant, m = regression coefficient, and x = value of the independent variable.
The value m is also defined as the slope of the line that fits the best.
So m  = y/x
